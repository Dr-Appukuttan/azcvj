	<h3 style="font-size:80px">Review</h3>
	<h5>Parrot Security OS</h5>
		<div>
			It is the best hacking distro ever used.&nbsp;
			It is smooth,lightweight and yeah it is more<br>
			It is designed to run on a 2gig RAM system so
			if u gotta 4 gig RAM perfect.&nbsp;But it do not give importance<br>
			to its looks.It has a simple UI.&nbsp;Also it has a <a href="https://t.me/parrotsecgroup" id="link1">Support Group</a> where u can ask the errors you face and thus things made much more easy.&nbsp;
			Only the thing is it do not support ARM devices thus it is not availabel to Pi users.&nbsp;
			If you got a 4 gig RAM and wanna do pentesting then go for 
			Parrot Security OS.&nbsp;
			Its home version is also available.&nbsp;
			Refer <a href="https://www.parrotsec.org" id="link2">https://www.parrotsec.org</a> for more details.
			<br>
			  <br><img src="photo/parrot.png"><br><br>
		</div>
	<h5>Arch Linux</h5>
		<div>
			It is a highly lightweight Distro.&nbsp;It can run on even a 1 gig RAM system<br>
			Only the hard part is that it's installation and setup is a bit hard and you need to be a master linux inorder to use it.&nbsp;But with the help of Google or DuckDuckGO
			you can set it up.&nbsp;And it has AUR repo from where you can install all tools.&nbsp;
			If you customize it and install some of those hacking tools u want then , it will be a perfect distro for hacking.&nbsp;
			Like for Parrot , it also has a <a href="https://t.me/archlinuxgroup" id="link3">Support Group</a> where you can ask your errors and solve 'em.&nbsp;
			As i said the only problem is it is not having a GUI installer(but can be installed from AUR.I haven't tried) and you gotta do all manually.<br>
			Visit <a href="https://www.archlinux.org" id="link4">https://www.archlinux.org</a> for more details<br>
		  Also there is a website called <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/" id="link5">arch wiki</a> where there is solutions for all erros and tutorials for programming,etc.
		<br><br>
		<img src="photo/arch.png"><br><br>
		  </div>
	<h5>Kali Linux</h5>
		<div>
			Another hacking distro which is used all over the world.&nbsp;The OS which comes into mind when we hear "hacking".&nbsp;Now this distro is also good like Parrot Security OS.&nbsp;
			But it needs about 8gig RAM to ensure smooth running.&nbsp;On a 4gig RAM system it get's headted up and when we start and IDE like VSCode or else,we feel like we are using Windows.&nbsp;
			There is No support group for Kali Linux.&nbsp;Only way to solve errors is by Kali Forms.&nbsp;
			And also Kali Linux is much more aware of their looks.&nbsp;They give importance to the sleek design and finish.<br>
			Kali Linux is officailly suported and mainted by Offensive Security.&nbsp;Kali has a wide variety of support.&nbsp;It supports ARM devices and also Mobile Phones.<br>
			Visit <a href="https://www.kali.org" id="link6">https://www.kali.org</a> for more info <br><br><br>
			<u>Kali Nethunter</u>.&nbsp;The phone version of Kali Linux is now also becoming a trend.&nbsp;It has all the tools of Kali Linux and it is same like Kali Linux.&nbsp;
			For Nethunter you need to root your phone and install the nethunter patched kernel for your phone.&nbsp; Also you can use rootless Nethunter in Termux.&nbsp;
			There is a <a href="https://t.me/kalinethunterofficialsupport" id="link7">Support Group</a> for Nethunter where you can ask your doubts and errors and get them solved.<br>
		  For more info visit <a href="https://www.kali.org/kali-linux-nethunter/" id="link8">https://www.kali.org/kali-linux-nethunter/</a> for more info.
		<br><br>

		 </div>
	<h5>Debian</h5>
		<div>
			Like Arch Linux,Debain is also lightweight and it is easy to install.&nbsp;Both the Parrot Security OS and Kali Linux is based on Debian OS.&nbsp;Debian is easy to use and if you are new to linux,I recommend you to start with Debain(You may see to start from Ubuntu on search engines but Debian is the best to start)&nbsp;
			It can run on a 1gig RAM system and it is smooth.&nbsp;Like Arch Linux,Debian also have a wiki where you can solutions for your errors and also learn programming,etc.&nbsp;
		  Visit <a href="https://www.debian.org" id="link9">https://www.debian.org</a> for more details.Also like ArchWiki there is also <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/" id="link10">wiki</a> for debian.
	<br><br>
	<img src="photo/deb.png"><br><br>
		  </div>
	<h5>Tails OS</h5>
	<div>
	  It is a debian based distro designed for high anomality.&nbsp;It erases all files before it switches off thus leaved behind no traces.&nbsp;
	  It starts Tor by default and it creates a new user at every boot even if persistent.&nbsp;It only save browser files,all other files are wiped.&nbsp;It is mainly used by journalists,criminals,etc like people.&nbsp;
	  You can access darkweb from that OS.Actually to access darkweb , there is no need of tails.&nbsp;Install tor and use.&nbsp;
	  Tails is used if you are somewhere else and you want to use a PC and you want to leave no evidences that you have used.&nbsp;You can also configure a liveusb and use Tails.&nbsp;
	For more info visit <a href="https://tails.boum.org/" id="link11">https://tails.boum.org/</a> for more details regarding it 
	<br><br>
	<img src="photo/tails.svg"><br><br>
	</div>
	<h5>Windows</h5>
		<div>
			As you know Windows is mainly desgined for day-to-day use and for ease of use.&nbsp;It is not recommended for neither hacking nor programming.&nbsp;It is designed for normal use like,creating document files,photoshop,etc.&nbsp;Windows is a widely Used OS.&nbsp;
			If you are on Windows 7 it is recommended to switch to 10 as 7 is no more supported and Win10 is more secured compared to Win7.(Saying from Experience).&nbsp; And the most secure is Linux.&nbsp;
			If you are a normal user like Just browsing into any social media or you do only paper works, I recommend Windows as it is more easy to use and 
			there are more apps for these kinda works compared to Linux.&nbsp;Also if you are a gamer , Windows.&nbsp;There is only a less no.of games for Linux.

	  <h2>Before Messaging ME</h2>
	  <div>
		So before messages please do read this.This is something I want you to focus.So please consider it's importance and read.<br><br>
		So there are many people who think that hacking is a crime and it's only use is to hack someone's facebook or insta or whatever.&nbsp;This is to them.&nbsp;
		So Hacking is an art(or you can say a skill) which is used to analyse the security flaws of a system or a website.&nbsp;Yes true there are black hats who hack to gain money or 
		hack fb to gain information but hacking sector is not only filled with them.&nbsp;
		Hackers include White Hat,Grey Hat and Black Hat.&nbsp;Among which the White Hats are the good people who hack for the good cause.&nbsp;They are the Cybersecurity Experts and many of 'em work for govs.&nbsp; .
		Another group of hackers are Grey Hats.&nbsp;They hack 
		inorder to find out security vulnerabilities in a software or programs.&nbsp;.They are the pentesters or security analysts.&nbsp;And also there are many who think that metasploit-framework is a tool to hack systems.&nbsp;It's real use is to 
		find out vulnerabilities of
		a system.&nbsp;.So use these tools wisely and please do not ask me to hack by saying "this person did this and that to my homies.Please hack him.His insta is such and such".&nbsp;I will never do it.&nbsp;So please avoid those kinda messages.
		Also if you want to learn hacking,please use your search engine.&nbsp;I am not a teacher to teach you. And also for god sake please do not ask my phone number.I'll not give it.As I am not 
		interested in whatsapp chatting and I am not ready to share my number with an unknown person.
		<br><br>
		  So any violation of this will lead to report and block.So please do follow.
